The *greatest problem* with the [*greatest invention*](/the-invention) is...

> Verbosity.

Everyone knows this in their hearts. From the data scientist starved of [quality sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing), to the exasperated teen longing for a [digital detox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_detox). From the [inundated researcher](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/are-scientists-doing-too-much-research), to the [fraudsters misusing LLMs](https://tldr.cdcl.ml/gpt-is-a-toy) to produce "novel work". It's a sea of obfuscation and duplication. It drives war.

In the words of Tolkien's *Treebeard*, "never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say". Excellent, but let's also say it [concisely](https://marketoonist.com/2023/03/ai-written-ai-read.html), eh?
